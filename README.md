This C++ rendition of the timeless Tic-Tac-Toe game enables a duo of players to alternate marking positions on a 3x3 grid using their designated symbols (X and O).
Victory is attained when one player successfully aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
Alternatively, should the grid fill up without a victor, the game concludes in a draw.
